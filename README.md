# Advanced Synthesis and STA Using Design Compiler and SkyWater130nm Library
This repository mainly focuses on the Synthesis part in the ASIC design flow. Here you will hget an idea on how we can create a gate level netlist from the RTL code and rechnology library. You will also get an idea about the Static Timing Analysis and how that is applied on the RTL to get required results.
For this process we have used Design Compiler which is offering from Synopsys. You can use any other software to do synthesis. Also as a technology library we have used SkyWater130nm library.
